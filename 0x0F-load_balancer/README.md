# 0x0F. Load balancer

## This project is an update to the 0x0C-web_server project:

It involves an upgrade to provide redundancy for my web servers which will allow it to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers
It will also make the web infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, there is still a second one to handle requests.
